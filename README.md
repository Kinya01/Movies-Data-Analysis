 Movies Data Analysis

## Overview
  Microsoft wishes to venture into the movies industry, however, they have little to no experience
  in the area and therefore they don't know where to start. As a data analyst, I am required to advise the company's decision based on the deductions made from movie cites data exploration. For example, 
## Problem Statement
Microsoft lacks expertise in the field of movie production, yet they intend to establish a new movie studio.

For the new movie studio to generate profit, Microsoft should consider the following factors:
- The most popular genre
- The run time for the movies
- The top studios
- The ideal period to release the movies based on the Average ROI of film release by month

# Data
For this research, I utilized data from two sources
- IMDB - IMDb (Internet Movie Database) is an online database that provides information about movies, television shows, actors, directors, and other industry professionals. It is one of the most comprehensive sources of film and TV-related information on the internet, and is widely used by people worldwide. It is a website that offers a vast collection of information related to the entertainment industry. It was founded in 1990 and has since become an invaluable resource for people interested in movies and TV shows.

The website allows users to search for information about specific movies, TV shows, or industry professionals. It also provides ratings and reviews from users, as well as from professional critics. Users can create accounts on IMDb to save their favorite movies and TV shows, and to rate and review them. In addition to movie and TV show information, IMDb also provides news and articles related to the entertainment industry, as well as a community section where users can participate in discussions about their favorite movies and TV shows.
- Box office Mojo
Box Office Mojo is an online box office reporting service that tracks box office revenue of movies released in theaters worldwide. It was launched in 1999 and acquired by IMDb (Internet Movie Database) in 2008.

The service provides box office revenue data for movies, including the opening weekend gross, domestic and international gross, and total gross. The website also provides information on theater counts, release dates, budgets, and other financial data related to movies. Users can search for specific movies and view their box office performance, as well as compare the box office performance of multiple movies.

Additionally, Box Office Mojo also provides news and analysis related to the movie industry, including predictions for upcoming releases and trends in box office performance. The website also has a comprehensive database of historical box office data, allowing users to track the performance of movies over time

# Results

## Most Favourable Runtime

The best runtime was approximately between 90 and 120 minutes. This means, therefore, that microsoft should produce movies running from 90 to 120 minutes to achieve profitable viewership.


## Top Studios

Affirm studio had the highest domestic earnings, but it only ranked fifth in terms of global earnings among all studios. This suggests that there is a disparity between the top earning studios domestically versus globally. Just because a movie studio performs well domestically, it does not necessarily mean that it will be a top earner on a global scale. Microsoft should therefore consider acquiring one of the top grossing studios globally such as BH Tilt, MBox and Orchard Film Studios

## Most Favourable Movie Release Months

The films that were released during the months of July, June, November and May yielded the greatest Return on Investment (ROI) respectively compared to those released during other months. On the other hand, movies that premiered in September, December, October and April had the lowest ROIs. Microsoft should therefore aim to release their movies in May, June, July and November for the most profitable viewership


## The Most Popular Genres

Documentary was found to be the most prevalent genre, accounting for over 35% of the films, followed by drama and comedy.
Microsoft should therefore consider producing these movies most for profitability


# Conclusion

Based on the movie analysis, the following conclusions can be drawn:
- It is advisable to produce movies with a runtime of 90 to 120 minutes.
- To optimize earnings, movie release dates should be limited to May, June, July, and November.
- Microsoft may consider acquiring one of the top grossing studios, such as BH Tilt, Neon, or Orchard Film Studios.
- It would be beneficial for Microsoft to produce movies in the most prevalent genres, namely documentaries, drama, and comedy.
